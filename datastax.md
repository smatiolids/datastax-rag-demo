## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Demonstration
This app is intended to illustrate how you can add relevant knowledge to an otherwise basic LLM Chat.  

Find a PDF with some information in it that an LLM wouldn't normally have. 
Before uploading the PDF, ask a question about some of the contents of the PDF.
Upload the PDF and ask the same question again.  With the new context, the LLM can give more informed answers.

How do you do this in your applications?  You need a vector database, and AstraDB is one of the best.
